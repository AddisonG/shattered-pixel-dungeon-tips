# Moving and mapping the floor

## Moving to find secret rooms

When moving, try to touch the walls of the room (if you haven't found a secret room yet).

You won't have enough resources to methodically search every single floor for a secret room that
might not even exist, but if you hug the walls when travelling, you'll be pleasantly surprised a
few times every playthrough when you stumble upon a secret room.

## Moving to avoid traps

It's hard to know when a trap is going to spring up. There's not really any formula that I know of,
but one way to minimise your danger is simply retracing your steps - I don't expect you to remember
every single tile that you've ever walked on, but if you're walking into a dead-end secret room
which has literally nothing in it except a piece of food, then make sure you walk out the same way
you walked in.

If you do roll a "treacherous ground" level, consider using a scroll of magic mapping, or stone
of clairvoyance. I often forget to use them, but those are the best levels to use them on.

## Being efficient

When moving, you want to avoid taking extra steps. Steps and actions take food, and food is health.

Some small tips:

- Instead of waiting for an enemy to walk to you, or walking to the enemy, begin walking to an item
- Make sure when you're trampling on grass looking for seeds/dewdrops, you don't just trample all of
it, and then pick up the seeds and dewdrops later. That's lazy
- Try to guess which doorways will lead to dead ends, and which will lead to more of the level,
so you can visit the dead-end rooms first, and not have to double back later because there's a room
you missed
- Avoid using the search action to look for secret rooms when at full health. If you're at full
health, that means you're not regenerating, which is like wasting free hp. Go fight an enemy, and
then look for rooms while you heal
