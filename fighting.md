# Fighting

## Fighting at a distance, and closing the gap

When you engage melee enemies, you will often see them from 2 or more tiles away.
This means that you have a few "free" turns before they enter melee range.

These turns should be viewed as a precious resource to be spent wisely, just like a potion.

### Where should I fight?

Never run towards the enemy, unless there's a very good reason to (e.g., You are between 2 enemies,
and you want to finish fighting one before the other reaches you)

Let them come to you - especially if that means fighting near a door or grass, where you can break
line-of-sight for a sneak-attack.

### Should I use a wand?

Almost always. Avoid leaving a wand on maximum charges, or you're wasting a precious resource.

See wands for more info.

### Should I throw a weapon?

Sometimes. It depends on the threat level of the enemy. Use wands first, since they are unlimited.

Ammunition is often in short supply, but if you get to the 21st floor, and still have a fishing spear,
it's not much use any more, as your enemies' block is so high, they'll only take 2 or 3 damage.

You want to use thrown weapons up before they become useless - So make sure your fishing spears and
throwing hammers are used up around floor 12.

On the other hand, you want to be very sparing with one specific ranged weapon - the bolas.
The bolas cripples an enemy, and will allow you to get multiple FREE melee attacks in on an enemy.
Definitely worth hoarding - it's great all game.

### Should I use a consumable?

There's rarely a time when I want to drink a potion or use a scroll before a fight, but runes, seeds
and spells are always worth considering. Generally, the only time you want to use a consumable
is when facing a highly deadly situation, such as:

- You're being attacked by a ranged enemy, and cannot take cover or break vision
- You're surrounded in a corridor by 2 powerful enemies, or will be soon
- A fast enemy is chasing you down, and you cannot handle it
- An overpowered enemy you cannot harm is after you (Animated Statue, Golden Mimic, Hostile Champion)

All of these can usually be solved, or at least delayed, by a well-placed runestone, seed, potion,
scroll or spell.

Here are some examples of good item usage in combat:

#### Stones

- Stone of Aggression
  - Lead an enemy around until you find another enemy
  - Good when you're surrounded
- Stone of Blast
  - Excellent for dealing with more powerful enemies, like Animated Statues
  - Don't be afraid to waste it
- Stone of Blink
  - Great for getting to Tengu in the second phase
  - Escape from ranged enemies
- Stone of Deep Sleep
  - Good panic button
- Stone of Fear
  - Good panic button
- Stone of Flock
  - Best used against gnoll shamans and dwarf warlocks, when you cannot break vision
- Stone of Shock
  - Good when you HAVE to use a specific wand, but don't have a charge

#### Seeds
#### Scrolls
#### Potions
#### Spells
