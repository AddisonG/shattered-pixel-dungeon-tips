As a mage, you should ...


# General Tips

- Take every opportunity to get a wand, as soon as possible. Examples
  - Crystal chests
  - Shopkeepers
  - Reward from mage quest
  - Farming Gnoll Shamans
- Food is incredibly useful for early wand charge and damage
-

# Shops
Priority list:
- Bags
- Any wand
- Potion of Healing
- Scroll of Remove Curse
- Ankh

# Farming

Gnoll shamans all have a 3% chance to drop a wand on death. After that, they have a 1% chance (and so on). It's definitely worth trying to stay around as long as you can to try and find a wand. An extra utility wand can be the difference between a win and a loss.

# Talents

## Tier 2 - Shield Battery
Easily the best talent in the game. This has countless uses, and should be exploited several times every floor.

This drains a single wand to 0 charges, and creates a shield using those charges. An otherwise useless wand of magic missile (3/3) can be used to gain a huge shield, usually 2x more powerful than any enemy can hit you for.

Best of all, **you can do this using cursed wands**! You don't even need to identify it! If you've got a few cursed wands - don't bother removing the curse - just use them as dedicated shield-wands.

This skill is good for:
- Preventing damage from poison, burning, bleeding, shocking, and gas
- Preventing delayed damage (armour of viscosity)
- Preventing damage from jumping down levels
- Preventing damage from Chalice of Blood
- Lasts for a surprisingly long time
- Better alternative than waiting
- Fantastic panic button

You can even use this to safely identify the upgrade level of an unidentified, but cursed wand.

Just make sure that the wand you're using actually has a charge - otherwise you just waste your turn doing nothing.

When engaging a distant enemy, simply charge up 1 turn before they reach you.

This wand has fantastic synergy with the Viscosity Glyph on Armour.

I try to keep 2 or 3 wands dedicated to using this ability.

Some case examples:

> I cast an unidentified wand of frost, and realise it's cursed
> I immediately cast it on myself, and get an 24HP shield
> I have 80HP max, so each charge gives me 6 shielding (`80 * 0.075`), or 4 shielding for talent lvl 1 (`80 * 0.05`)
> My 24HP shield must have consumed 4 charges
> My wand must have 5 charges (1 from testing it, and 4 from the shield)
> That means it must be a Wand of Frost +2
> Definitely worth using my last Scroll of Remove Curse on!

> I'm surprise attacked by a Cave spider, who poisons me, and starts to run away
> I shield myself with a spare wand of magic missile, preventing the poison damage
> I use my other wands to take out the cave spider as he retreats

> I'm fighting a vampire bat, wearing armour of viscosity, and have no wand charges
> Running from the bat is a bad idea - it's faster, so it'll get free hits, and heal to full hp.
> I fight for a few rounds, and finish it off. I now have 8 delayed damage.
> I take 2 steps, and one of my wands gets a charge back
> I immediately use the wand to shield myself, preventing the remaining damage

# Warlock

## Warlock-Specific Talents

### Tier 3 - Soul Eater
This ability is insanely good.

All the value here comes from proc'ing on-eat effects. The satiety gain here is a bit of a joke .
Assuming both on-eat effects are maxed,

### Tier 3 - Soul Siphon

- Somewhat useful *after* Necromancer's Minions is maxed
- Somewhat useful if you have a wand of living earth
- Somewhat useful if you have a wand of corruption
- Somewhat useful if you have a "corrupting" enchantment on a weapon

This is mediocre unless you have 2 of the above.


### Necromancer's Minions
