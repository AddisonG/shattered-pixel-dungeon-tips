# Items




## Food

Always keep exactly one piece of food, to ensure you're not starving before a boss fight.

If you're starving, you won't regenerate health, which can come out to 20 or 30 HP over the
course of a long fight.

Thankfully even if you are starving, you won't take starve damage during the boss fight.

## Bolas

A bolas used on a strong melee enemy can allow 3 or 4 free attacks without retaliation - potentially
saving hundreds of hitpoints over the course of the game.

Can be worth upgrading, to keep the durability of this item up.


## Shuriken

They're great for setting off traps, as they take no time to throw, and they can remove the "Parry"
effect from Dwarf Monks, preventing them from blocking a hit on your next attack.

Throwing them on traps, or at monks who parry them doesn't use durability.

I cannot stress how amazing it is to be able to remove the "parry" effect from monks without using
a turn. It's absolutely broken. Walk the monk through a door, as normal, throw the shuriken (parried),
and then sneak attack the monk like a normal enemy. After you defeat it, pick up the shuriken and
repeat.

What's even better is that AOE BLOB traps (like fire or electricity) only apply their effect at the start
of the turn, so you can stand IN the AOE effect, and as long as the next step you take lands you
outside of the AOE, you're all good, and won't get lit on fire or stunned. This is not the case for
other "instant" traps, such as dart traps or rockfall traps.

Always save your last shuriken. Don't let that last one break! You will need it to set off traps
at critical moments, and to remove the parry from monks later in the run, so dealing 3 more damage
to a crab isn't worth it.

If you don't have one, and see them in a shop, consider buying them, even if you have to walk back
for it. They're quite cheap, and are often better than a health pot over the course of a game.


## Scroll of Transmutation

I often upgrade these and use them on myself, trying to get a more powerful talent, but depending
on your artifact and ring situation, you may find better use in transforming one of them, especially
if their usefulness is dwindling. Often this might happen after the Imp quest. Consider transforming:

- Rings that are +2 or more, but you can not make good use of:
  - A ring of arcana, but no good enchantments
  - A ring of force, but you already have a better weapon
  - A ring of sharpshooting, but you have few ranged weapons, and lots of wands
  - A ring of energy, but you have very few wands, and a bad artifact
  - A ring of wealth, but it's very late in the game
  - A ring of tenacity, but you've already got upgraded plate armour
- Artifacts that are +10, and you have already gotten good use out of
  - An Alchemist's Toolkit, but it's very late-game
  - A Talisman of foresight, but you're a rogue
