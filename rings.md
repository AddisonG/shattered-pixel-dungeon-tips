# Rings


## Upgrading rings

Generally, I avoid upgrading rings, unless I am planning a strategy around them, and want to sink
2 or 3 scrolls into one.

For example:
 - A ring of sharpshooting can be game-breaking with huntress
 - A ring of speed is one of the most powerful items in the game, with the right other items
 - A ring of evasion is an excellent item when playing with the "faith is my armour" challenge
 - A ring of wealth is funny, if you feel the urge to farm for several hours
 - A ring of energy is incredible with the right assortment of wands
 - A ring of accuracy or furor can be good with gladiator

But knowing that you're able to get a +2 or +3 ring from the ambitious imp quest makes putting
upgrades into a ring any earlier than that less appealing, especially when you may not know what
other artifacts, weapons, wands and rings you're going to find, let alone weapon and armour
enchantments.


## Identifying rings early

You can identify 3 of the 12 rings in the game within a turn of equipping them, including their
upgrade level. Another 4 of the 12 can be identified with minimal effort.

Knowing what ring you have early can allow you to change your strategy sooner, and begin exploiting
the benefits of the ring immediately, and potentially even upgrading it. Or, it can help you realise
a ring has no benefit to you, and can be replaced by another ring which will help you.

### Ring of Might

Check your character strength as soon as you equip it. If you have `+1` str, then it's a `+0` ring.

### Ring of Sharpshooting

Check the maximum durability of a thrown weapon before and after equipping. If your Throwing Spear
had 1/10 durability, and now it has 1/12, that's a 20% increase, so you have a `+0` ring.

### Ring of Speed

Check the "turn timer" at the top left, and watch it move when you take a step. A practiced eye can
determine the level with just one step, or:

A level 0 ring means you walk 6 steps in 5 full turns
A level 1 ring means you walk 3 steps in 2 full turns

### Ring of Furor

Check the "turn timer" at the top left, and watch it move when you attack an enemy. A practiced eye
can determine the level with just one attack, or:

A level 0 ring means you get one free attack every ~11 attacks
A level 1 ring means you walk one free attack every ~5 attacks

### Ring of Wealth

Keep an eye out for a "flash" of colour when an enemy dies, and drops loot. This sometimes happens
before you have identified the ring.

### Ring of Energy

Go about your business as usual, and watch your wand charges. It should take about 45/41/37 turns to
regain a charge if only 1/2/3 were missing.

If you have a magic holster, the numbers are different, but you can usually consult the wiki:

If this number is off by more than 1, it's probably not a rounding error, and you can probably do
some quick math to find out if your wands are recharging 15% faster (+0), 32% faster (+1), etc.

### Ring of Force

I recommend against this, as it's quite high risk, but if you **suspect** you have a ring of force,
perhaps because you've been hitting harder than you feel you should, you can unequip a weapon and
try attacking an enemy. Either you will deal basically nothing, or you'll smack them for a
respectible amount.

This can be safer to do as a Rogue, who can use their cloak to escape or re-equip a weapon.
Or, if you have a reliable wand to buy time with (e.g., blast-wave, transfusion). Finally, it can
be safe to do if you have a guaranteed way to spawn a wraith, and can sneak attack it.

### Other Rings

Rings such as Tenacity, Arcana, Elements, Accuracy and Evasion are incredibly difficult to verify.
Thankfully these are generally less impactful rings, and so can be identified later on, if you
prefer to play it safe and keep other known, powerful artifacts/rings equipped instead while you
explore.
