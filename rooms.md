# Rooms


## Puzzle rooms

A puzzle room, as I refer to them, always has a guaranteed solution spawn on the floor.

Here are the puzzles room names, and their solution items:

| puzzle room               | solution item
| -                         | -
| piranha room              | potion of invisibility
| toxic gas room            | potion of purity
| secret chest chasm room   | potion of levitation
| traps room                | potion of levitation
| magical fire room         | potion of frost
| sentry room               | potion of haste
| wood door room (3 kinds)  | potion of liquid flame

If you manage to solve these rooms without the item, or even just see the room, it can allow you
to start narrowing down what potions can be what, allowing you to make a better guess with a stone
of intuition, or reduce your chances of drinking a fire potion instead of strength potion.

I recommend making the "aqua blast" spell as soon as possible, as it has 8 charges, and can solve
about half of the above rooms:
 - Trap room - Removes trap (without setting them off)
 - Magical fire room - Removes fire
 - Toxic gas room - Cast on the traps to stop gas, then come back in a few minutes. Might need 2 blasts
 - Sentry room - The sentry won't fire at you when you're standing on the water. Might need 2 blasts

And for the rooms with wood doors that need to be burned down, you can drop a seed of firebloom
right in front of the door, and set it off. Stone of blast also works, as does wand of fireblast,
and wand of disintegration.

## Crystal path room

This room has 3 potions on one side, and 3 scrolls on the other.

There is guaranteed to be either a scroll of transmutation, or potion of experience.
Furthermore, the rarest potion/scroll is always at the back, where you can only access one.

Thus, I recommend always using a stone of intuition on the potion/scroll in the farthest back room,
to check if it's the rare one, so you don't accidentally waste it.

I would recommend always getting the 2 scrolls at the back, because I value transmutation, much
more than experience.

## Crystal vault room

This room has 2 chests, which you can inspect to see what type of rare item is in each

Almost always take the wand, unless you're past floor 15, and you have somehow do not already have
an artifact/ring, and can see one. Or, past floor 20, you may want to find a better artifact, if
yours is not suited to combat.
