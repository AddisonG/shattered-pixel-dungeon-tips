## Goo

Make sure you never let its powered up attack hit you. There is simply never an excuse for letting
it hit. If you're using a spear, be extra careful - every second attack means the Goo will take
2 turns in a row.

If you are playing as the huntress, you can often win by finding a pillar and walking in circles
around it, until the Goo loses you, and you

### Juking with fire

If you are underpowered, the BEST trick to weaken (or sometimes defeat) the goo without even attacking it
is to use a fire potion or fire seed, and then walk around a specific path to keep the fire burning.

Fire burns for 7 turns, so you need to "refresh" the fire by walking through grass or a door, which
will catch on fire, thus refreshing the effect on the Goo.

Just make sure you PLAN your route early, and make sure you light the Goo on fire when it is exactly
one step away from you, so that when it's chasing you, it is RIGHT on your tail. You want to keep it
close, so you don't accidentally lose it, or it takes a weird path. Then you lead it the exact steps
you want it to take.

I cannot stress planning this route enough. You might be able to take a more efficient route if you
start in a different room, or if the Goo approaches from a different direction. Take as long as you
need. This is almost mandatory when running the "Badder Bosses" challenge.

For example, if this is the room layout

```
D = Doors
G = Grass

 ┌──────┐
 │      │
 │      │
─┴──D───┤
        │
        ├─────┐
        D     │
        │  GG │
        │   G │
        │─────┘
        │
──┬──D──┤
  │     ├─────────────
  │     D
  └─────┴─────────────
```

Here's where you would light the Goo on fire, and where you would lure it:

```
X = Light goo on fire here

 ┌──────┐
 │      │
 │      │
─┴──.───┤  <-- Step ONTO this door
   / \_ │
  /    \├─────┐

      / │
──┬──|──┤  <-- Step through more doors

  └─────┴─────────────
```
