## Sewers

Flies are great - always hunt them down, as they drop valueable health pots. You should make a
mental note of what colour potion they drop, as that will always be a health potion. If you have
a bad memory, you can even use your stone of intuition on it, but every second stone of intuition
is still consumed, even if you guess correctly, so technically it costs you 1/2 a stone.

Make sure that you purposefully split every fly swarm up as much as possible, and tackle them in a
chokepoint to avoid getting surrounded. Never let yourself get attacked by more than 1 enemy at once.

There is a max number of health potions that can be dropped from flies (I think 8?) and the chance
drops with every potion that is dropped, so don't worry too much about trying to get every single
potion, or trying to farm the levels - just make sure you don't run away from them and that's enough.

## Caves

WARNING: Do this **before** you face off against DM-300, or you may gain too many levels, and enemies will stop dropping items.

If you have a few potions to spare, or enough food, I strongly recommend hanging around the levels
where gnoll shamans spawn until one of them drops a wand. They have a 3% chance
of dropping a wand, but the chance drops massively each time a wand drops, so you probably only want
to farm the first wand, and only the second if you have a lot of resources to spare.
The chance for a wand to drop goes 3%, 1%, 0.33%, 0.11%, and so on.

Also take the chance to farm bats, which drop health potions.

Often, you will be starving as you farm, and that's fine.
Drink a health potion if you get below about 20% health, and keep on going.
The wand(s) that you farm will be more valuable in the long run, and if you're lucky, you'll gain
more health potions than you'll spend farming.
